### Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery and no other libraries, this web application will be fed an array of stock data. 

#### **With the following fields:**
	1. name
	2. price
	3. marketCap

##### A **bar chart** will display the market cap in **DESCENDING** order with the name of the stock to each bar. Tooltip were used to provide added information about the price and market cap of each bar hovered.

##### **Checkbox** were provided for the user to track the **Number Selected**, calculate the **Total Price and Average Price**.

##### A **Table** was included to display the results of checkboxes that were clicked. This is updated in accordance to the stocks that were clicked or unclicked.

#### **Four Metrics of Table**
	1. Number Selected - how many stocks are selected
	2. Total Price - the sume of the prices of the selected stocks
	3. Average Price - the average price of the selected stocks
	4. Stock with Highest Price - the name of the stock with the highest Price
